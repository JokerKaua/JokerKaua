## 📜 Experience

I did an internship at MPPR in Londrina, Paraná. In addition to secretarial services, I created web automation or spreadsheet programs to help with work. I made automations in javascript and python. I used the Asana API and libraries like pandas and selenium.

I was taking a java developer course for game programming. I did some projects in Java, using OOP concepts and frameworks like Canvas, for graphics in Java.

I did projects during the IT course that helped me develop logic and search for knowledge.
